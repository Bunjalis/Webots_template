I have attempted the Advanced Task (yes/no) : yes
If yes please provide a brief description on your approach:

In the BaseRobot class, their is a vector of pairs, where each pair contains 2 doubles.
This is where the leader robot stores the position of every OOI it detects. Once the robot has finished
detecting the OOI's, it loops through the vector, sending the location of an OOI to each robot, starting with
robot 1, then 2, then 3, then back to 1, repeating this pattern until every OOI is assigned.
Each scout robot when it recieves the location of the OOI, pushes this value to its own vector of pairs
(hence why it is in BaseRobot), then loops through that vector, running the moveToTarget function on each OOI.
